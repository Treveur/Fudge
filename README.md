An automatic texture packer for LÃ¶ve2D

Feed it a folder full of images and it will automagically generate a texture atlas and quads.
It can also export the generated data to reduce load times in production mode.

Planned features include JSON exports so generated data can be used in other engines.


## Planned features

+ JSON/XML Exports
+ Standalone texture packer
+ Smoother animation
+ Optional anti-texturebleed padding
+ Vertically stacked animation chops
